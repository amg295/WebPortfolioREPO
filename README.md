I have made most of the skeleton of the site in terms of html, but I am still learning how to create multiple pages. My next steps is to insert images and stylize the site with CSS attributes. In the end I hope to create a home page and 3 pages for the three roommates showcaing the different art styles. I hope to match the aesthetic for each page in terms of font and colors.
