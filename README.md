# WebPortfolioREPO
My plan for this website was to showcase my art as well as my roommates' art with each of us having our own gallery page on the site. I think I was able to execute the site to the best of my abilities, yet I had immense difficulty with this project. I put in many hours of effort, yet this is something that I definitely need more instruction on if I ever want to do this again in the future. I tried to keep it simple and easy to navigate that highlighted both the artists on the home page and then the pictures of art work. I put captions on the images to clarify some of the images that were slightly ambiguous.
